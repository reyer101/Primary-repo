On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:
	- Ok, so when I cloned this repository and compiled the code, it gave me some "weird" errors regarding "HEAD >>>>>"
	and whatnot. However, if I just run the code without compiling it, it works just fine. I don't know if there's some weird glitch in pushing it to git, but the program works if you don't recompile it once cloning it (the error happened to be in the server side). Overall, your code is well written and I liked how you implemented a state system in your code. I think you could have gotten rid of some of the comments since they just were code snippits as well as telling the clients that they can type out a message to the server if it's their turn.
