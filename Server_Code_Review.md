On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:
The ChatServer doesn't display the messages for both clients as was required in this assignment.
This could be remedied by adding a println(clientname + "sent" + sendMessage);
after line 199 to create a log of who sent what in the server
